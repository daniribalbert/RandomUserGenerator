# Random User Generator!

### Project Description
Random user generator uses https://randomuser.me/ to create a list of random users.
This is a sample project to demonstrate the usage of a few Android features.

That's my first time building a small app fully on Compose! :)


## What to  look for?

### REST API
This is handled with the help of [Retrofit][1]. The best library to handle that.

### Image Loading
Images are loading using [Coil][2]. Currently the best option to load images in the Compose world.

### Koin
Dependency Injection! [Koin][3] provides DI without all the boilerplate from dagger.

### Coroutines / Flow
Easy threading done with full kotlin support. Goodbye Rx!

### Compose
Android is slowly migrating towards [Compose][4]. That's something I want to practice and improve!
